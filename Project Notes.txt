Module: Cluster Event Notification Module
	Kafka streaming analytics platform
	Membership module
	keeps track of its members
		i have 10 members
	grab events from kubernetes API
	whenever a new member subscribes or existing member goes down
		services need to know abt other services
	
	running in a kubernetes env
	other microservices that can subscribe to it
	publish all these events to its subscribers
	reliable
	no events should be missed
	each event should only be processed only once
	
also allows clients to specify heirarchy
	one subscriber may receive a notification before another subscriber
	subscriber with higher priority should process event before subscriber with lower priority
	
Observability and Visibility
	several logs for CEM for all events
	log analysis tool that can describe the behavior, errors, and matrix 
	logs are all in text form
	prometheus
	grafana

Doing simulations for CEM

1.	CEM log analysis to provide stats and Metrics
Log analysis provides useful metrics that paint a clear picture of what has happened across the CEM and its clients . We can use this data to improve or solve performance issues within CEM. Looking at the bigger picture, we need to analyze logs to proactively and reactively mitigate risks, unerstand behavior and get stats. We can use Atlantic Add-ons like Graphana, Prometheus etc.. to search and analyse

Python automation tests
Describe a time when you worked under many teams
Type of working environment
why tesla
tell me about yourself
When you had to deliver quickly
Had to learn something new and how

i have to keep a history of queue state
queue state changes whenever an event message gets queued or removed
fixed interval polling
what to dump?
	ged-id
	event_name
	cur_mem_list (just their subsc. ids)

svc_name is same as subs_name

root@10.227.98.58 
Password ChangeM3!
cem and cem_client  are installed

Metrics to Display:

Dump Queue state changes --> whenever event-message gets Queued, or gets removed
   { Gen-id, event_name, producer_name, (cur_mem: subs_id_list)}, 

Subscriber_list { {subs_Id, subs_name, last_event_posted, birth_gen_id, last_event_rcvd, ctr_reboot_times, ctr_svc_down, subs_status},    } 

Failed Notification
   {Gen_id; pri_id, subs_id},  { ...},  {...}


//clus reg parser

//subscriber list parser

//failed notification parser

//TBD parser

Timestamp
Event Gen id
Event Name
	Service Up
	Service down
	Custom Event
Current Members
Subscriber ids

Subsc
If a message failed to get queued
Qstate info limited
subscriber list has more details than just qstate changes

do the json parsing for all event types
	req ack
	req subs
	req publish
	req unsub
	
service up, service down, custom

Catch-Up Tasks
service down, no ack are the two types of failur

CEM server notifies everybody
server will keep waiting for ack until service down
